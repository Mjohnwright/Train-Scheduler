# Train-Scheduler
Train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.

In order to code time variable more convenient, I used Moment.js.  This library makes it easier to format time variables.

Enter the name of your favorite train and track it's frequenct of departure.  You can enter any and all trains (or for that matter you can also enter a bus or plane).

The app refreshes every 60 seconds or when a new data is entered.
